It represents an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n      local government.\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see this doc(https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\n\nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the Coronavirus pandemic(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\nexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our\nusual Github entry(https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in this document(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like CAP(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a WebContent type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"text\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, openingHours, Event, FAQPage etc. By linking to those pages from a SpecialAnnouncement you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the category property of the SpecialAnnouncement.\n\nMany SpecialAnnouncements will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use spatialCoverage for the region, and announcementLocation to indicate specific LocalBusinesses and CivicStructures. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both spatialCoverage and announcementLocation.\n\nThe about property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using about only\nfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a Course or a RadioStation). For places, use announcementLocation and spatialCoverage. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of about for locations too.\n\nThe basic content of SpecialAnnouncement is similar to that of an RSS(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or Atom(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed.

If known, the main entity this statement is about can be indicated using mainEntity. For more formal claims (e.g. in Fact Checking), consider using Claim instead. Use the text property to capture the text of the statement.","https://schema.org/StatisticalPopulation":"A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property populationType is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a StatisticalPopulation representing all Persons with a homeLocation of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate homeLocation and populationType properties to a StatisticalPopulation item that stands for that set of people.\nThe properties numConstraints and constraintProperty are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statistical\npopulation, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a populationType of Event or NewsArticle could be used. See also Observation, where a populationType such as Person or Event can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use StatisticalVariable instead of StatisticalPopulation.","https://schema.org/StatisticalVariable":"StatisticalVariable represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for StatisticalVariable is typically expressed using Observation with an explicit populationType, which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each StatisticalVariable is marked as a ConstraintNode, meaning that some properties (those listed using constraintProperty) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a StatisticalVariable Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is Person; the measuredProperty height; the statType median; the gender Female. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of StatisticalVariables, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The measurementMethod, unitCode and unitText properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement.

Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).","https://schema.org/Surgical":"A specific branch of medical science that pertains to treating diseases, injuries and deformities by manual and instrumental means.","https://schema.org/SurgicalProcedure":"A medical procedure involving an incision with instruments; performed for diagnose, or therapeutic purposes.","https://schema.org/SuspendAction":"The act of momentarily pausing a device or application (e.g. pause music playback or pause a timer).","https://schema.org/Suspended":"Suspended.","https://schema.org/Syllabus":"A syllabus that describes the material covered in a course, often with several such sections per Course so that a distinct timeRequired can be provided for that section of the Course.","https://schema.org/SymptomsHealthAspect":"Symptoms or related symptoms of a Topic.","https://schema.org/Synagogue":"A synagogue.","https://schema.org/TVClip":"A short TV program or a segment/part of a TV program.","https://schema.org/TVEpisode":"A TV episode which can be part of a series or season.","https://schema.org/TVSeason":"Season dedicated to TV broadcast and associated online delivery.","https://schema.org/TVSeries":"CreativeWorkSeries dedicated to TV broadcast and associated online delivery.","https://schema.org/Table":"A table on a Web page.","https://schema.org/TakeAction":"The act of gaining ownership of an object from an origin.

When maintainer is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a Dataset, it is always  possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer.

This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. \n\nFor example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: \"mass spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or \"immunofluorescence\". If the variableMeasured is \"depression rating\", the measurementTechnique could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck Depression Inventory\". \n\nIf there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue for each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique.
